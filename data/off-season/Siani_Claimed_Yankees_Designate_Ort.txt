Siani claimed off waivers; Yankees designate Ort

The Yankees claimed outfielder Michael Siani off waivers from the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Siani, 26, appeared in 19 games with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2025, batting .235 (4-for-17) with four runs and two walks. He played 17 games in center field. He spent most of the season with Triple-A Memphis, hitting .209 with 64 runs, 12 doubles, four triples, eight home runs, 41 RBIs, 50 walks and 28 stolen bases in 101 games, appearing at all three outfield positions.

Over parts of four Major League seasons with the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals, Siani has batted .221 with 48 runs, seven doubles, two triples, two home runs, 20 RBIs, 24 walks and 21 stolen bases in 160 games, playing all three outfield positions.

Originally drafted by the Reds in the fourth round in 2018, Siani has been designated for assignment and claimed on waivers multiple times in recent seasons, most recently by the Dodgers in December 2025.

To make room on the 40-man roster, the Yankees designated right-hander Kaleb Ort for assignment.
