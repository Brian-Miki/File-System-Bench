Cubs, Chas McCormick Agree To Minor League Deal

The Cubs are signing free-agent outfielder Chas McCormick to a minor league contract and inviting him to major league camp. McCormick became a free agent after being outrighted by the Astros following the 2025 season.

McCormick, 31, enjoyed several productive seasons with Houston from 2021 to 2023, posting a .259/.336/.449 slash line with 50 home runs and a 120 wRC+ over 342 games. His best season came in 2023, when he hit 22 home runs, stole 19 bases, and earned strong defensive marks across all three outfield positions, primarily in center field.

Since the start of 2024, McCormick has struggled offensively, batting .211/.273/.301 with six home runs in 386 plate appearances. He was placed on waivers and elected free agency at the conclusion of the 2025 season.

For Chicago, the move provides low-risk outfield depth. With recent roster changes opening competition for a reserve outfield role, McCormick offers experience, right-handed power, and a strong track record against left-handed pitching. He will need a strong spring performance to earn a roster spot but could factor into the Cubs’ plans if he rebounds.
