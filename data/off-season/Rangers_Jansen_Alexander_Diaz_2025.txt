Rangers sign catcher Jansen to 2-year deal, also add relievers Alexander, Díaz
December 16, 2025

The Texas Rangers addressed one of their biggest offseason needs by signing free-agent catcher Danny Jansen to a two-year contract with a mutual option for 2028. The deal is worth $14.5 million.

Texas also added bullpen depth, agreeing to one-year deals with left-hander Tyler Alexander and right-hander Alexis Díaz.

The Rangers had been searching for a catching complement to Kyle Higashioka after Jonah Heim was non-tendered. Jansen, who debuted in 2018, ranks ninth among primary catchers in bWAR since that season and has posted an OPS+ above 100 in four seasons since 2021.

Jansen split the 2025 season between the Rays and Brewers, hitting 14 home runs with a .720 OPS, a mark higher than any Rangers catcher over the previous two seasons. Known for his fly-ball-heavy approach, Jansen consistently looks to pull the ball in the air, while defensively he excels at blocking pitches, ranking near the top of MLB in blocks above average since 2019.

While Jansen has dealt with injuries in recent years, he avoided the injured list in 2025 and appeared in 98 games.

The bullpen additions further raise the Rangers’ pitching floor. Alexander signed for $1.125 million with incentives, while Díaz — a former All-Star — looks to rebound after a difficult 2025 season split across three teams. Both fit the Rangers’ philosophy of prioritizing strike-throwing and pitch efficiency.

With these moves, Texas continues reshaping its roster ahead of the 2026 season.
