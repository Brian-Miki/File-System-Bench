Yanks claim former top prospect Luciano off waivers

The Yankees claimed infielder/outfielder Marco Luciano off waivers from the Orioles, taking a chance on the former top prospect.

Luciano, 24, was once ranked as the Giants’ top prospect and appeared on MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 prospects list from 2020 to 2024, known for his electric bat speed and right-handed power. However, he struggled to translate those tools to the Major Leagues during limited time with San Francisco from 2023 to 2024, batting .217 with a .590 OPS in 41 games.

He spent the entire 2025 season at Triple-A Sacramento, hitting .214 with 21 doubles, 23 home runs and 66 RBIs over 125 games while playing mostly left field. Across 500 Minor League games, Luciano owns a .246/.355/.445 slash line.

Luciano has changed organizations multiple times this offseason, having been claimed off waivers by the Pirates and Orioles before landing with the Yankees. The move fills a spot on New York’s 40-man roster, with at least one additional roster move expected once Cody Bellinger’s contract is finalized.
