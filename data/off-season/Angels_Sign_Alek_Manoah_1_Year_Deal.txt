The Angels announced Tuesday that they have signed right-hander Alek Manoah to a one-year deal worth $1.95 million.

Manoah, 27, was an All-Star with the Blue Jays in 2022 and represents a reclamation project for the Angels under new manager Kurt Suzuki and pitching coach Mike Maddux. He is the second pitcher added this offseason, joining Grayson Rodriguez, who was acquired in a trade for outfielder Taylor Ward.

Manoah finished third in AL Cy Young voting in 2022 with a 2.24 ERA and 180 strikeouts over 196 2/3 innings, but struggled with command in 2023 before undergoing Tommy John surgery in June 2024. He returned to pitch in the Minors in 2025 and finished the season healthy.

With the Angels in need of pitching depth, Manoah will compete for a rotation spot and offers upside if he can regain his previous form.
