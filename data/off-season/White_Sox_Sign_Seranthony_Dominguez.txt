White Sox To Sign Seranthony Domínguez

The White Sox and right-hander Seranthony Domínguez have agreed to a two-year, $20 million deal. Domínguez is expected to serve as the club’s closer, though Chicago will need to make a corresponding roster move to finalize the signing.

Domínguez, 31, has primarily worked as a setup reliever throughout his career. He debuted with the Phillies in 2018 and posted a 2.95 ERA across 58 innings, striking out 32% of batters while generating a high ground-ball rate. Injuries, including Tommy John surgery in 2020, limited him over the next few seasons, but he returned to form over the past four years.

From 2022 through 2025, Domínguez threw 222 1/3 innings for the Phillies, Orioles, and Blue Jays, recording a 3.60 ERA with a 27% strikeout rate. He collected 24 saves and 55 holds during that span. In 2025, he altered his pitch mix, leading to a career-high walk rate but also his best full-season strikeout rate. He was a key bullpen arm during Toronto’s postseason run, making 12 playoff appearances.

While his profile carries some volatility, Domínguez’s power arsenal has consistently produced results. He was viewed as part of the second tier of free-agent relievers this offseason and signed a deal slightly above initial projections.

The White Sox enter the season in a rebuild but have been active in free agency, adding short-term contracts to improve roster competitiveness while maintaining long-term payroll flexibility. Domínguez steps in as the most experienced reliever on the roster and is likely to handle ninth-inning duties, giving Chicago stability at closer while also positioning him as a potential trade candidate if the club falls out of contention.
