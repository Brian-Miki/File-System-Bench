CHICAGO -- The White Sox agreed to terms on a two-year, $34 million deal with Japanese free agent slugger Munetaka Murakami, the club announced Sunday.

Murakami will be eligible for free agency, not arbitration, after the 2027 season and will wear No. 5. The White Sox are scheduled to introduce Murakami at a news conference Monday morning.

Murakami’s posting period began on Nov. 7, opening a 45-day negotiating window for all 30 MLB teams. The 25-year-old stood out as one of the most anticipated international free agents of the offseason.

A two-time NPB MVP (2021 and 2022), Murakami was also a four-time All-Star and the 2019 Central League Rookie of the Year. He helped lead the Tokyo Yakult Swallows to a Japan Series championship in 2021.

Murakami’s 2022 campaign ranks among the greatest power-hitting seasons in baseball history. At age 22, he hit 56 home runs, breaking Sadaharu Oh’s long-standing record for most homers in a single season by a Japanese-born player. He also won the batting Triple Crown with a .318 average, 56 home runs, and 134 RBIs.

The White Sox have found success with Japanese players in the past, including Tadahito Iguchi and Shingo Takatsu during their 2005 World Series run, and Murakami’s signing signals a renewed investment in that international market.

Murakami joins a young White Sox core that includes Colson Montgomery, Chase Meidroth, Kyle Teel, Edgar Quero, Shane Smith, and Grant Taylor.

Over eight NPB seasons, Murakami posted a career slash line of .273/.394/.550 with 265 home runs and 722 RBIs across 1,003 games.

He enters MLB after a 2025 season limited by an oblique injury, but he still slugged 22 home runs in just 56 games, posting a 1.043 OPS.

While some evaluators have raised questions about strikeouts, swing-and-miss rates, and defensive fit, Murakami’s elite left-handed power gives him one of the highest ceilings of any international free agent in recent years.

Murakami also starred on the international stage during the 2023 World Baseball Classic, helping Japan win gold with multiple clutch hits, including a 115.1 mph home run in the championship game against the United States.
