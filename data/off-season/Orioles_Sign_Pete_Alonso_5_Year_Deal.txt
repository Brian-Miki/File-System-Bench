Orioles finalize 5-year deal with Pete Alonso

ORLANDO, Fla. — The Baltimore Orioles finalized a five-year, $155 million contract with first baseman Pete Alonso, marking one of the largest free-agent signings in franchise history.

The deal includes a partial no-trade clause and represents the highest average annual value ever given to a first baseman, as well as the highest AAV in Orioles history. It is the second-largest total contract in club history, trailing only Chris Davis’ seven-year deal signed in 2016.

Alonso, 31, significantly upgrades a Baltimore offense that underperformed in 2025. A five-time All-Star and two-time Home Run Derby champion, Alonso won his first National League Silver Slugger Award in 2025 after hitting .272 with 38 home runs, 41 doubles, 126 RBIs, and an .871 OPS while playing all 162 games.

Across seven MLB seasons with the New York Mets, Alonso has hit 264 home runs, including at least 34 in each of the past five seasons. He has received MVP votes in three of the past four years and is widely regarded as a strong clubhouse presence.

Baltimore pivoted to Alonso after Kyle Schwarber re-signed with the Phillies. The Orioles’ front office, backed by the David Rubenstein-led ownership group, has signaled a new willingness to spend as the club attempts to rebound from a last-place finish in 2025.

Alonso’s arrival creates a logjam at first base, with Ryan Mountcastle and Coby Mayo potentially becoming trade candidates as the Orioles continue searching for pitching upgrades.

The signing underscores Baltimore’s emergence as an aggressive player in the free-agent market and signals a new chapter for the franchise heading into the 2026 season.
