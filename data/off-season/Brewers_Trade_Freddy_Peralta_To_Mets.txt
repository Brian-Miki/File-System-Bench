Brewers Trade Freddy Peralta To Mets

The Mets acquired All-Star right-handed starter Freddy Peralta and swingman Tobias Myers from the Brewers in a blockbuster trade for prospects Jett Williams and Brandon Sproat. New York designated right-hander Cooper Criswell for assignment to make room on the roster.

Peralta, coming off a career season in which he finished fifth in NL Cy Young voting, gives the Mets a legitimate front-line starter. He logged 176 2/3 innings with a 2.70 ERA, strong strikeout rates, and improved home run suppression. Known for a mid-90s fastball with plus spin, a changeup usable against both handednesses, and multiple breaking balls, Peralta has been one of the league’s most consistent starters over the past five seasons. He brings durability, having avoided the injured list for three straight years, and is under contract through the 2026 season.

Myers, 27, profiles as a versatile swingman who can provide rotation depth. He pitched effectively for Milwaukee over the past two seasons, including a strong rookie campaign in 2024. Myers features a low-to-mid-90s fastball, cutter, slider, and a reworked splitter that improved his results against left-handed hitters. He remains under club control through 2030 and has a minor league option remaining.

For Milwaukee, the return centers on Williams and Sproat, both highly regarded prospects. Williams, a first-round pick in 2022, is an athletic middle infielder with speed, patience, and defensive versatility, while Sproat is a near-MLB-ready right-hander with a deep pitch mix and mid-to-upper-90s velocity. The Brewers move another star approaching free agency while maintaining their competitive outlook, leveraging prospect depth to retool rather than rebuild.
