Mets pick up versatile utilityman from Twins

The Mets acquired switch-hitting utility infielder Vidal Bruján from the Twins in exchange for cash considerations.

Bruján, who turns 28 in February, was designated for assignment by Minnesota after the club acquired utility infielder Tristan Gray. Once a top prospect in the Rays’ farm system, Bruján has not been able to translate his Minor League success to the Major League level. Across five MLB seasons with five different teams, he owns a career .199/.267/.276 slash line.

Known for his speed in the minors, Bruján stole 147 bases between Class A and Triple-A from 2018 to 2021, but he has gone 16-for-30 on stolen-base attempts in the Majors. During the 2025 season, he appeared for three different teams.

The Mets have been active this offseason, adding multiple impact players via free agency and trade. With infielder Luisangel Acuña dealt away in a recent trade, Bruján provides additional infield depth and positional versatility for New York going forward.
