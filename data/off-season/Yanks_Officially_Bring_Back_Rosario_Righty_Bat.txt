Yanks officially bring back Rosario, adding much-needed righty bat

NEW YORK -- The Yankees had already secured a playoff spot when Amed Rosario reclined at his clubhouse locker late in September, reflecting on a half-season in pinstripes that had exceeded expectations.

Acquired in a Trade Deadline deal from the Nationals, the veteran infielder/outfielder was swinging well against left-handed pitching. His presence was also being felt in the dugout: he and Jasson Domínguez were the loudest voices in the cheering section of “La Esquina Caliente,” or, “The Hot Corner.”

“It’s like we have a podcast,” Rosario said. “We’re talking about everything, about life. We’re paying attention to the game, too. We try to give the best energy we can for our teammates, and we play like the Hot Corner too. I always tell the guys, ‘I know how it feels to play for the other side. When you get a big hit against the Yankees, it’s more important.’”

Rosario officially returned to the Yankees on Tuesday, with the club formally announcing his one-year contract, which was agreed upon back on Dec. 13. Terms of the deal were not released, but a source said Rosario will earn $2.5 million this coming season.

The 30-year-old batted .303 with three doubles, one home run and five RBIs in 16 games for New York last year after being acquired from Washington on July 26.

Between Washington and New York, Rosario hit .276/.309/.436 with six homers and 23 RBIs in 63 games, including a .302 mark against left-handed pitchers. Defensively, he appeared at third base, second base, right field and shortstop.

General manager Brian Cashman reiterated his desire to seek right-handed balance, noting the team’s vulnerability against left-handed starters.

Rosario joins several players from the Yankees’ 2025 roster who have returned this offseason, providing roster continuity and much-needed right-handed depth.
