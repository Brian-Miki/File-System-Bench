The Diamondbacks announced on Friday that they have signed right-hander Merrill Kelly to a two-year deal that includes a vesting option for 2028. The pact is worth $40 million, sources told MLB.com.

Originally drafted by the Rays in the eighth round in 2010, Kelly did not reach the Majors with Tampa Bay. After the 2014 season, he signed to play in Korea for four seasons before returning to MLB with Arizona in 2019.

After early struggles, Kelly became a fixture in the Diamondbacks’ rotation, earning the nickname “Merrill the Mainstay.” Aside from the shortened 2020 season and an injury-plagued 2024, he has consistently made at least 27 starts per season.

In 172 Major League starts, Kelly owns a 3.77 ERA and a 113 ERA+. He was traded to the Rangers at the 2025 Trade Deadline but made it clear he hoped to finish his career in Arizona.

After signing Mike Soroka earlier in the offseason, bringing back Kelly helps stabilize Arizona’s rotation heading into 2026.
