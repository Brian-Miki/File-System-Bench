Twins bring back Taylor Rogers to fortify bullpen with one-year, $2M contract

The Minnesota Twins signed left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers to a one-year, $2 million contract, bringing the veteran back to the organization as part of a broader bullpen overhaul. The team also finalized a two-year, $14 million deal with catcher Victor Caratini.

Rogers returned to Target Field for a physical after agreeing to terms. During his first six Major League seasons with the Twins, he posted a 3.15 ERA across 319 appearances, striking out 361 batters in 314 2/3 innings. He transitioned into a closer role in 2019 and earned an All-Star selection in 2021.

Over the past four seasons, Rogers has pitched for five different teams following trades and free-agent moves. Now 35, he carries a career 3.34 ERA in 566 relief appearances, with 626 strikeouts, 83 saves, and more than 500 innings of experience. Originally drafted by Minnesota as a starter in 2012, he was converted to a reliever before his Major League debut.

Rogers joins a rebuilt Twins bullpen after the club dealt several top relievers last season. He is expected to provide both on-field production and veteran leadership.

Caratini, 32, will back up catcher Ryan Jeffers and also see time at first base and designated hitter. He hit .259 in 2025 while setting career highs in home runs, RBIs, and plate appearances. To make room on the roster, the Twins designated right-hander Pierson Ohl and catcher Jhonny Pereda for release or assignment.
