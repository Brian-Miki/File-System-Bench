Mariners trade for swingman Criswell to boost pitching depth

The Mariners added to their pitching depth, acquiring right-handed swingman Cooper Criswell from the Mets for cash.

Criswell, 29, was designated for assignment by New York after being selected off waivers from the Red Sox in December. He pitched in seven games for Boston in 2025, including one start, posting a 3.57 ERA in 17 2/3 innings. At Triple-A Worcester, he made 14 starts and two relief appearances, recording a 3.70 ERA in 65 2/3 innings.

In the Major Leagues, Criswell has worked as both a starter and reliever. He started 18 of 26 games for the Red Sox in 2024 with a 4.08 ERA. He made his MLB debut with the Angels in 2021, later pitching for the Rays before signing one-year deals with Boston in 2024 and 2025.

Criswell was designated for assignment by the Mets to clear a 40-man roster spot and could compete for a bullpen role with Seattle, whose bullpen posted a 3.72 ERA in 2025. He may also serve as a spot starter if injuries arise.

To make room on the roster, the Mariners designated left-hander Jhonathan Díaz for assignment.
