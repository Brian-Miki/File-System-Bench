Bregman signs 5-year, $175 million deal with Cubs

CHICAGO -- Alex Bregman officially joined the Cubs on Wednesday, with the team announcing a five-year agreement with the veteran third baseman.

According to multiple reports, the contract is worth $175 million and includes no opt-outs and a full no-trade clause. The deal represents the third-largest contract in Cubs history by total value and carries the highest average annual salary the organization has ever given, though a significant portion of the money is deferred.

The Cubs have pursued Bregman in free agency in each of the past two offseasons, seeking to add his leadership, offensive production and defensive reliability to a roster aiming to become a consistent postseason contender. Chicago finally completed the deal just ahead of the team’s annual Cubs Convention.

Bregman, a three-time All-Star, two-time World Series champion and Gold Glove winner, spent the 2025 season with the Red Sox after opting out of his previous contract. He hit .273/.360/.462 with 18 home runs in 114 games, despite missing time with a quadriceps injury, and helped Boston reach the postseason.

The 31-year-old previously spent nine seasons with the Astros, where he developed into one of baseball’s premier infielders and postseason performers. Over his career, Bregman owns a .272/.365/.481 slash line with a 132 OPS+ and multiple top-five MVP finishes.

Bregman’s addition deepens Chicago’s infield, allowing him to take over at third base alongside Dansby Swanson, Nico Hoerner and Michael Busch. His postseason experience and impact bat are expected to play a key role as the Cubs push to challenge for the National League Central title.
