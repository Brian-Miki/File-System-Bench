Catcher J.T. Realmuto re-signs with Phillies on three-year deal

PHILADELPHIA — Catcher J.T. Realmuto and the Philadelphia Phillies finalized their $45 million, three-year contract on Tuesday.

Realmuto will earn salaries of $15 million in each of the next three seasons and can earn up to $5 million annually in award bonuses.

His bonuses include $2 million for All-Star election and $1 million for All-Star selection, $1 million each for winning a Gold Glove or Silver Slugger, and $2 million for finishing in the top 10 of MVP voting.

A three-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, Realmuto made his decision a month after designated hitter Kyle Schwarber also chose to remain with the Phillies, agreeing to a $150 million, five-year deal.

Realmuto, who turns 35 in March, hit .257 with 12 home runs and 52 RBIs in 134 games last season, when he tied for the major league lead with 132 games caught. He was in the final season of a $115.5 million, five-year contract.

Realmuto owns a .270 career batting average with 180 home runs and 677 RBIs across 12 seasons with the Miami Marlins (2014–18) and the Phillies.

Philadelphia also reached offseason agreements with right-hander Brad Keller (two years, $22 million) and outfielder Adolis García (one year, $10 million).

Infielder/outfielder Weston Wilson was designated for assignment to open a roster spot.
