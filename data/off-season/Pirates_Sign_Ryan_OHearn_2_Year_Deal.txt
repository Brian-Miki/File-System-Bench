Pirates finalize 2-year deal with All-Star O'Hearn

First baseman Ryan O'Hearn was always one of the Pirates’ top targets this offseason. As a desired free agent, O’Hearn needed to do his research first.

Some of it was about the 2025 team, especially on the pitching side. O’Hearn noted that the Pirates’ staff ranked in the top 10 in ERA, WHIP and strikeouts, and he wanted to be part of a winning foundation.

Other research focused on the projected 2026 roster, particularly after the Pirates acquired Brandon Lowe from the Rays in December. O’Hearn, a former Oriole, had followed Lowe closely in the AL East and said the move helped convince him to sign.

A phone call with manager Don Kelly also played a key role. Kelly discussed O’Hearn’s journey from being designated for assignment by the Orioles in 2023 to becoming an All-Star starter in 2025, a path Kelly personally related to after being DFA’d multiple times in his own career.

After that conversation, O’Hearn was ready to commit.

The Pirates finalized a two-year, $29 million contract — the largest free-agent hitter deal in franchise history — adding a proven left-handed bat to address what was the league’s worst offense in 2025.

O’Hearn said he is excited to join Pittsburgh, praising the city, the ballpark, and the team’s potential to contend in 2026. He brings defensive versatility at first base and the outfield, along with leadership and clubhouse presence.

Pirates management believes O’Hearn’s resilience and experience will help elevate the lineup as the club pushes toward a postseason berth in 2026.
