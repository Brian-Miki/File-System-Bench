Giants sign 'legitimate fifth starter option' Houser to 2-year deal

The Giants added a veteran arm to their rotation on Friday, signing right-hander Adrian Houser to a two-year deal that includes a club option for 2028. The pact is worth $22 million.

Houser's agreement came shortly after San Francisco announced the signing of former Tigers closer Jason Foley to a one-year deal to bolster its bullpen.

Houser was one of the most pleasant surprises during the first half of the 2025 season, even though he didn’t pitch in a game until May 20. He started the year in the Rangers’ system, but Texas released him on May 15 after he logged a 5.03 ERA over nine appearances (eight starts) for Triple-A Round Rock. Houser signed a one-year contract with the White Sox a few days later and then tossed six scoreless innings against the Mariners in his season debut.

Over the next two-plus months, Houser produced a 2.10 ERA across 68 2/3 innings for Chicago and held opposing batters to three home runs, a .661 OPS and a 4.9% barrel rate.

After being traded to the Rays at the 2025 Trade Deadline, Houser struggled to replicate that success, posting a 4.79 ERA over 56 1/3 innings.

Houser, who turns 33 in February, has pitched nine Major League seasons and owns a career 4.00 ERA across 129 games (97 starts). He relies heavily on a 94 mph sinker and generates a high ground-ball rate.

In San Francisco, Houser joins a rotation headlined by Logan Webb, Robbie Ray and Landen Roupp, providing the Giants with additional depth as they continue to explore further pitching additions this offseason.
