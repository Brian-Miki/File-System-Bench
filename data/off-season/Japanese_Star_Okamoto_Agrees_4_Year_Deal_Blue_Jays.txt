Japanese star Okamoto agrees to 4-year deal with Blue Jays

TORONTO -- The Blue Jays signed Japanese third-baseman Kazuma Okamoto to a four-year contract, continuing Toronto’s aggressive offseason as it reloads for another run at the World Series.

The deal is worth $60 million with a $5 million signing bonus, and it does not include opt-outs.

One of the top Japanese free agents available this offseason, the 29-year-old Okamoto has long starred for the Yomiuri Giants and brings an immediate offensive upgrade to the Blue Jays’ lineup.

This move follows a blockbuster offseason for Toronto that included the signing of Dylan Cease to a seven-year, $210 million deal, the addition of starter Cody Ponce and reliever Tyler Rogers, and Shane Bieber opting in for 2026.

Okamoto represents a major splash in the Japanese market. In 2025, he was limited to 69 games due to a left elbow injury, but he hit .327 with a .416 on-base percentage, .598 slugging percentage, 15 home runs and 49 RBIs.

He also starred for Japan at the World Baseball Classic, posting a 1.278 OPS in the 2023 tournament, including a home run in the championship game.

For nearly a decade, Okamoto has been a consistent middle-of-the-order force for Yomiuri, with six consecutive seasons of 30-plus home runs and a peak of 41 in 2023.

The signing impacts Toronto’s pursuit of other top free agents, positioning Okamoto as the club’s primary option at third base while reshaping the rest of the infield and outfield mix.
