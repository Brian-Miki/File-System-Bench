Rangers land coveted lefty Gore from Nats in blockbuster trade

The Rangers acquired left-handed pitcher MacKenzie Gore from the Nationals in exchange for a package of prospects, bolstering their starting rotation as they push to contend in 2026. The deal was headlined by 2025 first-round Draft pick Gavin Fien, along with several other top prospects.

Gore, a 2025 All-Star, is under club control through the 2027 season. He went 5-15 across 30 starts for Washington in 2025, posting a 4.17 ERA over 159 2/3 innings. He was dominant in the first half of the season before fading late, though he still finished with career highs in strikeouts, quality starts, and overall value.

Known for his five-pitch mix and mid-90s fastball, Gore joins a Rangers rotation that already ranked among the best in baseball last season. Texas views the move as a clear signal of its intent to compete, even after recent roster turnover, and believes its pitching and medical staff can help Gore put together a more complete season.

To acquire Gore, the Rangers sent shortstop Gavin Fien, right-hander Alejandro Rosario, infielder Devin Fitz-Gerald, outfielder Yeremy Cabrera, and first baseman/outfielder Abimelec Ortiz to Washington.
