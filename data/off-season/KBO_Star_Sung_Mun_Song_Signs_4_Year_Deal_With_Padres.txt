SAN DIEGO -- The busy Padres have landed one of the most coveted international free agents on the market, finalizing a four-year deal with infielder Sung-Mun Song on Monday.

The deal is worth $15 million guaranteed, with an opt-out after the first three seasons and a $7 million mutual option for the 2030 season, according to a source.

Song, 29, is a left-handed-hitting infielder who starred in the KBO with the Kiwoom Heroes. He broke out in 2024 and 2025, prompting the Heroes to post him on Nov. 22 and open a 30-day negotiation window with MLB teams.

Song said he spoke extensively with former Padres infielder Ha-Seong Kim before choosing San Diego, citing the team culture, staff, city, and opportunity to challenge himself at the MLB level.

The Padres view Song as a versatile roster piece capable of playing second base, third base, and potentially first base or the outfield. With Manny Machado and Xander Bogaerts both in their 30s, Song provides flexibility for rest days and matchup-based lineups.

In 2025, Song hit .315 with a .387 on-base percentage, .530 slugging percentage, and .917 OPS, adding 26 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 144 games. He was voted KBO Player of the Year by his peers. In 2024, he posted a .340 batting average with a .927 OPS.

Padres president of baseball operations A.J. Preller praised Song’s progression, versatility, and charisma, noting that the club believes he can impact games both offensively and defensively.

Song made his KBO debut in 2015 at age 18 and steadily developed into one of the most intriguing international position-player prospects before making the jump to Major League Baseball.
