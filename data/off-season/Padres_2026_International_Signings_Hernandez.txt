Potential 5-tool standout Hernandez among Padres' 2026 int'l signings

The Padres continued their strong presence on the international market, signing Cuban shortstop Joniel Hernandez, a potential five-tool standout and one of the top prospects in the 2026 class. San Diego also added left-handed pitcher Diego Serna from Mexico and infielder Timothy Mogen out of Curaçao.

Hernandez received a $1.4 million signing bonus, the largest the Padres awarded from their international bonus pool. A premium athlete with significant physical projection, Hernandez features a quick, right-handed swing and has impressed evaluators in tournaments across the Dominican Republic. While he has primarily played shortstop as an amateur, his athleticism could allow him to move to center field or another infield position as he develops.

Serna is regarded as one of the top pitching prospects in the 2026 international class. He represented Mexico at the U15 World Cup in 2024, striking out 12 batters over seven one-hit innings. Typically sitting in the low 90s, Serna will spend his first professional season developing his delivery and secondary pitches.

Mogen brings size, athleticism, and defensive versatility, projecting as a rangy infielder with strong makeup. Together, these signings reflect San Diego’s continued emphasis on building organizational depth through international free agency, an approach that has helped the club consistently replenish its farm system.
