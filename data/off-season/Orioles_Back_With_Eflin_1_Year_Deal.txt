Back with O's on 1-year deal, Eflin eager to 'show what I really am'

BALTIMORE -- As the Orioles continue to bolster their rotation depth for the 2026 season, they have reunited with a familiar arm who is eager to prove what he's still capable of.

Baltimore signed right-hander Zach Eflin to a one-year Major League deal with a mutual option for 2027. The contract guarantees $10 million.

Eflin’s 2025 season was heavily impacted by injuries. The 31-year-old had three stints on the injured list due to a right lat strain and low back discomfort, and he underwent a lumbar microdiscectomy on Aug. 18.

“These guys wanted me back after missing all those starts and having an arm injury and having a back surgery. I get a chance to go back and show what I really am,” Eflin said.

After beginning to throw in early November, Eflin is hopeful he can have a normal Spring Training and be ready for Opening Day. He expressed optimism about his recovery, saying he feels better than ever.

In between injuries last season, Eflin posted a 5.93 ERA in 14 starts. However, Baltimore knows he is capable of much more, as evidenced by his strong performance after being acquired from the Rays prior to the 2024 Trade Deadline, when he recorded a 2.60 ERA in nine outings.

Eflin helped the Orioles secure a Wild Card berth in 2024 and also contributed in the postseason. His best season came with Tampa Bay in 2023, when he went 16-8 with a 3.50 ERA and finished sixth in AL Cy Young voting.

With Eflin back in the fold, the Orioles add depth, experience, and leadership to a rotation aiming to rebound in 2026.
