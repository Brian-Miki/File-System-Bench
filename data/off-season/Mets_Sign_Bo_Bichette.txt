Mets Sign Bo Bichette

The Mets officially signed infielder Bo Bichette to a three-year, $126MM contract, completing a rapid pivot after missing out on Kyle Tucker. The deal carries a $42MM annual value, includes opt-out clauses after the 2026 and 2027 seasons, and provides Bichette with a full no-trade clause. If he opts out, he can earn an additional $5MM bonus. The contract contains no deferred money.

Bichette, 27, adds a premier bat to the Mets’ lineup. After an injury-plagued 2024 season, he rebounded in 2025 with one of the strongest campaigns of his career, hitting .311/.357/.483 with 18 home runs. He was especially dominant over the final four months of the season before a knee injury ended his regular season early. Despite playing through that injury, he delivered a standout performance in the World Series.

A career .294/.337/.469 hitter, Bichette combines elite contact skills with above-average power and strong batted-ball metrics. While his defense at shortstop has long been questioned, the Mets plan to deploy him primarily at third base, where even average defense would pair well with his offensive production.

The signing significantly increases the Mets’ luxury tax burden, placing them deep into the highest penalty tier. Even so, the organization prioritized short-term, high-value spending to secure a prime-aged, multi-time All-Star. The move also creates roster flexibility and increases the likelihood of future trades involving the team’s surplus of infielders as the Mets continue reshaping their roster for contention.
