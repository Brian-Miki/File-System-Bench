J-Ram near extension to stay with Guardians through 2032 (source)

Over his 13-year career in Cleveland, José Ramírez has emerged as the face of the Guardians franchise and an all-time icon in Cleveland sports. Now, the 33-year-old is close to a contract extension that could keep him in Northeast Ohio for the rest of his career.

Ramírez is nearing an extension with the Guardians that would span through his age-39 season. He has three years and $69 million remaining on the seven-year extension he signed in 2022, and the new deal would effectively be a seven-year, $175 million contract running through 2032. The team has not confirmed the deal.

Under the terms, Ramírez would receive a full no-trade clause and annual salaries of $25 million from 2026–32, with $10 million deferred each season and paid beginning in 2036. His award bonuses would be doubled, including $500,000 for winning MVP, $300,000 for finishing second or third, and $150,000 for a fourth- or fifth-place finish. Additional perks include private jet travel for All-Star Game appearances and an extra hotel room on road trips.

Ramírez has long expressed appreciation for Cleveland, which he has called home since signing with the organization in 2009. Since making his MLB debut in 2013, he has evolved from a utility player into one of the best players in baseball.

He has earned seven All-Star selections, six Silver Slugger Awards, and has posted a career slash line of .279/.353/.504 with 398 doubles, 285 home runs, 949 RBIs, and 287 stolen bases. He is approaching the 300 home run–300 stolen base milestone, a feat achieved by only eight players in MLB history.

In recent seasons, Ramírez has climbed the Guardians’ all-time leaderboards, becoming the franchise leader in extra-base hits and multi-homer games while ranking near the top in home runs, RBIs, and stolen bases. With the length of the proposed extension, he could finish his career as the most decorated player in franchise history.
