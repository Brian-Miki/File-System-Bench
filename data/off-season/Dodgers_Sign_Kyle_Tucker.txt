Dodgers Sign Kyle Tucker

The two-time defending champions officially announced a four-year, $240MM contract with Kyle Tucker. The deal includes $30MM in deferrals and carries an approximate $57.1MM annual value for luxury tax purposes. Tucker receives a $64MM signing bonus, most of it paid upfront, and has opt-out clauses after the second and third seasons. Outfielder Michael Siani was designated for assignment in a corresponding move.

Los Angeles will pay $54MM of the signing bonus next month, with the remaining $10MM due in February 2027. Tucker will make a $1MM salary in 2026, followed by $55MM in 2027 and $60MM annually for the final two years if he does not opt out. The Dodgers are deferring $10MM annually in the final three seasons.

Tucker, who turns 29 this month, joins an already star-studded Dodgers lineup featuring Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts and others. Although not considered quite at the level of recent megastars like Aaron Judge or Juan Soto, Tucker is viewed as a consistent All-Star and one of the league’s top hitters.

After injuries disrupted portions of his 2024 and 2025 seasons, Tucker still finished with production in line with his career norms. The Dodgers believe they are adding a top-10 to top-15 hitter in baseball, capable of 25–30 home runs in a healthy season, while providing adequate defense in the outfield.

The signing pushes Los Angeles’ competitive balance tax payroll to historic levels, reinforcing the organization’s aggressive pursuit of a third consecutive World Series title.
