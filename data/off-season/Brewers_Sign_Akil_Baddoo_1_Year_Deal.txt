MILWAUKEE — The Brewers signed outfielder Akil Baddoo to a one-year deal on Thursday. Infielder/outfielder Greg Jones also signed a Minor League deal with an invitation to big league camp.

Drafted by the Twins in 2016 and taken by the Tigers in the Rule 5 Draft in 2020, the 27-year-old Baddoo has played parts of five Major League seasons with Detroit. Since his MLB debut in 2021, he has posted a .224/.305/.369 slash line with 28 home runs and 104 RBIs.

Baddoo appeared in only seven games with the Tigers during the 2025 season, but he rebounded at Triple-A Toledo, where he hit .281/.385/.483 with 15 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 103 games. He will enter the 2026 season with one Minor League option remaining.

He joins Milwaukee as the Brewers continue to receive interest in their controllable outfield depth, including Garrett Mitchell, Blake Perkins and Isaac Collins. With multiple options and years of control across the group, the club is under no immediate pressure to make a move.

Baddoo was designated for assignment by Detroit following the 2024 season before re-signing with the organization on a Minor League deal.
