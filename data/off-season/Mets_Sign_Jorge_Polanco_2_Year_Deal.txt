December 13, 2025 | Sportsnet

Jorge Polanco has agreed to a two-year, $40 million contract with the New York Mets, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan.

Polanco, 32, is expected to move to first base, replacing Pete Alonso, who signed with the Baltimore Orioles earlier in the week. He is coming off a strong 2025 season with the Seattle Mariners, where he hit .265 with 26 home runs and 78 RBIs in 138 games.

He played a key role in Seattle’s postseason run, including a two-homer game against Tigers ace Tarik Skubal and a walk-off single in Game 5 of the ALDS to send the Mariners to the ALCS.

A native of the Dominican Republic, Polanco spent most of his career with the Minnesota Twins (2014–2023), earning an All-Star selection in 2019, before being traded to Seattle prior to the 2024 season. He owns a career slash line of .263/.330/.442.

Polanco joins a Mets infield that includes Francisco Lindor, Jeff McNeil, and Marcus Semien.
