HOUSTON -- The Astros announced baseball’s first big splash of 2026 on Friday by inking Japanese right-hander Tatsuya Imai to a three-year contract that includes player opt-outs after the 2026 and 2027 seasons.

The deal is worth $54 million, according to a source. Imai can earn $3 million in incentives if he throws 100 innings in 2026. If he does, his base salary becomes $21 million in both 2027 and 2028. He had longer-term deals with lower average annual values available but chose Houston’s shorter-term, higher-AAV deal with opt-outs.

Imai was posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball club, the Saitama Seibu Lions, on Nov. 19, opening a 45-day window for MLB teams to negotiate with him. He becomes one of only a few Japanese players to play for the Astros, joining Kaz Matsui, Nori Aoki and Yusei Kikuchi.

The signing reflects Houston’s push to be more competitive in the Japanese and Korean markets. Imai is one of four starting pitchers acquired this offseason as the Astros prepare for the possible departure of left-hander Framber Valdez in free agency.

Imai, 27, was a three-time NPB All-Star and has developed into an ace-level pitcher. In 2025, he went 10-5 with a 1.92 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 163 2/3 innings, pitching in a combined no-hitter. Over eight seasons in Japan, he posted a 3.15 ERA with 907 strikeouts in 963 2/3 innings.

Imai features a mid-to-upper-90s four-seam fastball, a high-swing-and-miss slider, and a changeup effective against left-handed hitters. He is regarded as the top Japanese pitcher transitioning to MLB for the 2026 season.
