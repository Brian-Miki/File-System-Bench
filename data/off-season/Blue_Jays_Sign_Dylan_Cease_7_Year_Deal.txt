TORONTO — The Toronto Blue Jays made the biggest splash of the MLB offseason by agreeing to a seven-year, $210 million contract with right-handed pitcher Dylan Cease, the largest free-agent deal in franchise history.

The contract surpasses the six-year, $150 million deal signed by George Springer and immediately positions Cease as the ace of Toronto’s rotation. Although Cease is coming off a 2025 season in which he posted a 4.55 ERA over 168 innings with the Padres, his durability and elite strikeout ability made him the Blue Jays’ top target.

Cease has thrown more than 165 innings in each of the past five seasons and recorded over 200 strikeouts in all five, averaging 11.3 strikeouts per nine innings. His fastball averaged 97.1 mph last season and is paired with one of the most effective sliders in baseball, making him an ideal project for the Blue Jays’ pitching staff.

With Cease joining a rotation that already includes Kevin Gausman, Shane Bieber, José Berríos and rookie standout Trey Yesavage, Toronto now boasts one of the deepest and strongest starting rotations in baseball. The move also provides long-term stability as Gausman and Bieber are set to reach free agency after the 2026 season.

By striking early and aggressively before the Winter Meetings, the Blue Jays sent a clear message that their recent World Series appearance was not a fluke and that championship contention is the expectation moving forward.
