Blue Jays sign Eloy Jimenez, four others to minor-league deals

The Toronto Blue Jays have signed designated hitter Eloy Jiménez and four others to minor-league contracts with invitations to the team's 2026 major-league spring training.

Joining Jiménez on minor-league deals are infielder Carlos Mendoza, left-hander Michael Plassmeyer, right-hander Jorge Alcala and utility player Rafael Lantigua.

Jiménez, 29, is a former Silver Slugger winner and top prospect. The Dominican native had a brief stint with Toronto back in August on a minor-league deal. He is looking to rediscover the power stroke that saw him hit 31 home runs as a rookie with the Chicago White Sox in 2019.

The six-foot-four, 250-pounder struggled in 2025, batting .247 with 13 extra-base hits over 54 minor-league games split between the Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays organizations. Over 534 career MLB games, Jiménez owns a .269 average with 95 home runs and 298 RBIs.

Alcala, 30, brings experience on the mound with 200 big-league appearances, primarily with the Minnesota Twins. He spent 2025 with the Twins, Boston Red Sox, and St. Louis Cardinals, posting a 6.22 ERA while maintaining a 23.7 percent strikeout rate.

Lantigua, 27, was once a member of the Blue Jays organization from 2016 until 2024 but never played in the big leagues. Last season, he played 125 games for the Philadelphia Phillies’ Triple-A affiliate, hitting .230 with seven home runs while playing shortstop, second base, third base, and all three outfield spots.

Mendoza, 26, spent his entire career in the Detroit Tigers' system. The left-handed hitter batted .287 with an .803 OPS between Double-A and Triple-A last season.

Plassmeyer, 29, played with the Texas Rangers’ Triple-A affiliate last season, going 9-4 with a 4.43 ERA in 28 appearances.

Pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to the Blue Jays' training facility in Dunedin, Florida, next month.
