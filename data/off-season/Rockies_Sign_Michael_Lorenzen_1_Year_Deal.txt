Rockies finalize 1-year deal with veteran RHP Lorenzen

DENVER -- Veteran right-hander Michael Lorenzen has agreed to help the Rockies reimagine their pitching plans.

The Rockies announced they have signed Lorenzen to a one-year deal that includes a club option for 2027. The contract guarantees Lorenzen $8 million for the 2026 season, with a $9 million club option for 2027. To clear room on the 40-man roster, the Rockies designated right-hander Bradley Blalock for assignment.

Lorenzen, who turned 34 on Jan. 4, will be a rare free-agent starter without prior Rockies experience to sign with the club. The Rockies have largely avoided the open market for starting pitchers in recent years, but new general manager Josh Byrnes noted increased veteran interest in shorter-term deals.

After finishing 43-119 last season, the Rockies’ starters posted a 6.65 ERA, the highest in MLB since ERA became an official statistic in 1913.

Lorenzen spent the first seven years of his career with the Reds and has since pitched for the Angels, Tigers, Phillies, Rangers, Royals and Astros on a series of one-year contracts. He posted a 4.64 ERA over 141 2/3 innings in 2025, with his highest strikeout rate in a full season since 2019, though he also allowed a career-high 25 home runs.

His best pitch remains his changeup, which generated a strong whiff rate in 2025. Lorenzen also adds veteran experience to a young Rockies rotation, which otherwise featured few pitchers beyond their rookie seasons last year.
