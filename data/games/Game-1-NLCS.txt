Title: Dodgers survive Brewers' rally after Blake Snell domination in NLCS opener

The Los Angeles Dodgers survived the Milwaukee Brewers’ magic act and a tense ninth-inning rally to secure a 2-1 victory in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series at American Family Field.
The Dodgers were led by a historic performance from two-time Cy Young winner Blake Snell. Snell became the first pitcher in postseason history to strike out at least 10 batters and allow just one hit without a walk through eight innings. He faced the minimum number of batters through his eight frames, inducing 11 ground balls and allowing only one fair fly ball to the outfield the entire game.
“He's a bona fide ace," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “Having him take the ball, feeling that he's always essentially going to be the best option on the mound."
Snell has been on a remarkable run, yielding a 0.68 ERA in his last six starts. In his three postseason starts this year, he is 3-0 with a 0.86 ERA. Andrew Friedman, Dodgers president of baseball operations, noted that Snell's maturation and October presence were exactly what the team envisioned when they signed him to a five-year, $182 million contract.
The game also featured one of the most bizarre defensive sequences in playoff history. In the fourth inning, with the bases loaded, Max Muncy hit a 404-foot drive that bounced off the center-field wall. Brewers center fielder Sal Frelick nearly made the catch, but the ball was ruled live. In the resulting confusion, the Dodgers’ baserunners froze. Teoscar Hernandez was thrown out at home, and Will Smith was forced out at third. It was the first 8-6-2 double play in postseason history.
Offensively, the Dodgers broke the deadlock in the sixth inning when Freddie Freeman hit a solo home run off Chad Patrick. It was Freeman's first home run of the 2025 postseason. The Dodgers added a crucial insurance run in the ninth when Abner Uribe walked Mookie Betts with the bases loaded.
That extra run proved necessary. Dodgers closer Roki Sasaki struggled in the ninth, allowing a run and leaving with two outs and runners on the corners. Veteran Blake Treinen entered the game, walked William Contreras to load the bases, but ultimately struck out Brice Turang to end the game.
The victory was a significant shift for the Dodgers, who were swept 6-0 by the Brewers during the regular season. As Friedman noted, "Those games weren’t played in October."
