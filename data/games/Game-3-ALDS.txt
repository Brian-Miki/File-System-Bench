Title: Tigers on brink of elimination after late rally falls short in G3

DETROIT -- The rains that dampened Comerica Park all Tuesday afternoon finally let up for the Tigers and Mariners to resume their AL Division Series just as evening approached. And as Detroit readied to take the field at home for the first time in 16 days, the orange of the towels the sellout crowd twirled mixed with the orange of the setting sun reflecting off the city skyline. It was a surreal snapshot that exceeded what the Tigers could have imagined, though by the end of the night, it seemed to fit the mood of a crowd fearing the sunset of the Tigers’ incredible season.
After an unbelievable two-week road trip, the Tigers returned home to some of the same misfortune they left. They remain without a home win since Sept. 6, and after Tuesday night’s 8-4 loss to the Mariners put them on the brink of elimination, they’ll have to break the streak behind Casey Mize in Game 4 to extend their season and hand the series back to Tarik Skubal for a Game 5 in Seattle.
“Our confidence level has to be high. It doesn't matter who we're facing or what happened tonight,” Kerry Carpenter said. “We have to tip our hat to them doing well tonight.”
Hinch aligned all he could to counter the Mariners’ strengths, but Seattle simply overpowered Detroit. Hinch arranged his lineup to force a decision on whether to stick with Logan Gilbert for a third meeting with Carpenter or use a lefty reliever. Carpenter got his third matchup with Gilbert in a big situation with runners on the corners and one out in the fifth. He hit a grounder to beat out a potential inning-ending double play and put the Tigers on the board, but he couldn’t change the game.
“He was doing a good job,” Carpenter said of Gilbert. “Wish I would've just trusted my hands a little more there, but he stuck to his plan. It was clearly just soft, soft, soft, and it ended up working out for him.”
Carpenter is hitless since his two-run homer in Game 1. The Mariners have pitched him carefully since then, and they’ll likely do the same in Game 4 with Bryce Miller.
The ninth inning showed how quickly momentum can change, even in defeat. With an 8-1 lead, the Mariners turned to left-hander Caleb Ferguson. Hinch unleashed his right-handed hitters off the bench: Jake Rogers singled, Jahmai Jones walked, Spencer Torkelson doubled them home, and Andy Ibáñez singled home Torkelson. The rally forced Wilson to call on closer Andrés Muñoz, who needed just nine pitches for three outs to end the game.
“We knew it wasn't going to be easy,” Hinch said. “We're going to have to earn it and play better in all aspects against a really good team. And we can, because we have a really good team, too.”
