Title: Padres' sturdy bullpen never gets a lead to protect in playoff ouster

CHICAGO -- The ending? Familiar. Painfully familiar. The 2025 Padres spent the winter, spring and summer determined to atone for last October’s bitter ending -- only for the same bitter ending to befall them again. Another winner-take-all game on the road. Another unsatisfactory showing from the San Diego offense. Another postseason exit earlier than they ever anticipated.
The Padres are headed home after a 3-1 loss to the Cubs on Thursday in Game 3 of the National League Wild Card Series at Wrigley Field. After their Game 5 Division Series loss to the Dodgers a year ago, it’s the second consecutive year the Padres’ season has ended with disappointment in a winner-take-all game.
“This sucks,” said center fielder Jackson Merrill, who accounted for the Padres’ only run with a solo homer in the ninth inning. “This one hurts. I thought last year hurt. But this one hurts. Tight-knit group, a bunch of grinders. We had injuries left and right, still putting up a fight. It just didn’t go our way.”
In the biggest games, in the biggest moments, there simply wasn’t enough offense to be found. The Padres scored five runs in the entire three-game Wild Card Series -- after famously being shut out over the final two games of their 2024 playoff run.
The Padres’ pitching staff gave just about everything on Thursday. Michael King covered a relief inning, closer Robert Suarez entered in the sixth, and Adrian Morejon pitched for a third straight day. Jeremiah Estrada entered with the bases loaded and no outs in the second inning and allowed just one of those runners to score.
“They gave us a chance,” said Fernando Tatis Jr. “And we definitely missed an opportunity.”
Tatis struggled all series, particularly in the finale, where he struck out three times in an 0-for-4 showing. The Padres had plenty of opportunities on Thursday, but they finished 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position -- routinely thwarted by brilliant plays from the Cubs defensively, specifically from Dansby Swanson at shortstop.
The Padres kept fighting and nearly pulled off a miracle comeback in the ninth. Merrill led off with a towering drive into the basket in right field. Xander Bogaerts followed by working the count full, then looked at a pitch several inches below the strike zone that was called strike three. A typically even-keel Bogaerts grew irate, yelling in the direction of home-plate umpire D.J. Reyburn.
“You can’t go back in time, and talking about it now won’t change anything,” Bogaerts said. “But it was bad. Thank god for ABS [automated ball-strike system] next year.”
Following that, Ryan O’Hearn and Bryce Johnson were hit by pitches and advanced on Jake Cronenworth’s groundout. Freddy Fermin came to the plate with the tying runs in scoring position and two outs, but he lifted a deep fly ball into the glove of Pete Crow-Armstrong to end the season.
“We’re a family,” Merrill said. “It sucks. You’re breaking up with family. Some guys aren’t going to come back, some guys will. But we love everybody in here.”
