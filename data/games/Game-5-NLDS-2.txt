Title: Brewers conquer hurdle, win 1st postseason series since '18 to advance to NLCS

MILWAUKEE -- The Brewers have gone into postseasons as underdogs and as favorites. They have been hot and cold, home and away, with a multitude of stars or a collection of unheralded out-getters. And yet no matter the circumstances, the result of each of their last five forays into October since 2019 had been the same: One and done.
Not this year. This year, the Brewers are moving on.
William Contreras and Andrew Vaughn each hit go-ahead solo home runs and Brice Turang shrugged off a miserable series to mash a huge insurance shot while five Brewers pitchers allowed only six baserunners while cobbling their way to 27 outs and a 3-1 win over the Cubs in winner-take-all Game 5 of the National League Division Series. It snapped Milwaukee’s streak of six consecutive postseason series losses, sent the rival Cubs home and propelled the Brewers onward to the NLCS against another rival in the star-studded Dodgers.
“This was more than the usual Division Series,” said Christian Yelich. “We just really wanted to perform for our city and this organization and our fanbase. We knew it meant a little bit extra.”
The Brewers had taken control of the first postseason matchup between these Interstate 94 rivals with early-inning scoring barrages in Games 1 and 2, lost control while dropping Games 3 and 4 at Wrigley Field, then returned home to settle things in front of 42,743 fans.
“I haven’t let out a scream like that in 15 years,” Brewers owner Mark Attanasio said. “This reminded me of getting over the hump and getting to the playoffs in 2008. Five years of futility. So it’s huge to get back to the NLCS.”
Once again, the first inning set the tone. Trevor Megill, the Brewers’ All-Star closer, made the start as an opener. Contreras homered with two outs in the bottom half of the first, making this the first series of at least five games in postseason history to feature a first-inning home run in each game. While Seiya Suzuki answered with a homer for the Cubs, rookie flamethrower Jacob Misiorowski settled in, delivering 12 outs on 54 pitches. He was followed by Aaron Ashby, Chad Patrick, and Abner Uribe, who secured the first multi-inning save of his career.
The Brewers didn't shy away from the memory of last year’s late-inning collapse against the Mets. They embraced it. “At the end of last season, we sat down in the room and were all shellshocked," manager Pat Murphy said. "I said, ‘Guys, I don’t know what to tell you. Somehow, this is going to help us.’ And sure enough, it was prophetic.”
Once Uribe induced a two-out bouncer from Cubs catcher Carson Kelly, and shortstop Joey Ortiz converted it into a victory, the Brewers no longer had to answer questions about a postseason series losing streak.
